# Visitor-style dispatch refactoring

- Replace `dynamic_cast` chains in `Interpreter::eval` / `Interpreter::exec` with a proper visitor pattern
- Introduce AST visitor interfaces for expressions and statements
- Add `accept(...)` methods to all AST node types
- Migrate incrementally, keep behaviour parity with existing tests
- Remove dynamic-cast chains once all nodes dispatch through visitors
- Goal: clearer extension path and stronger compile-time coverage when adding AST nodes
- Intentionally deferred until feature set is more stable
